Oak's learning on how to organize a farmer's market on the web...

So, I had already designed state machines with HTTP diagrams, so I took those:

[Farmer](http://i.imgur.com/hEnrSFw.png?1)

[User](http://i.imgur.com/lsLkRfW.png?1)

[Market](http://i.imgur.com/iwqdVZQ.png?1)

...and then have to combine the elements of usability of all three to create the html structure for it:

index.html
inventory.html
farmer_submit.html
